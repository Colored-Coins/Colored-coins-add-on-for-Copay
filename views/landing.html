            The software you are about to use functions as a free, open source, and multi-signature digital wallet.

All transaction requests are irreversible.  The authors of the software, employees and affiliates of Bitpay, copyright holders, and BitPay, Inc. cannot retrieve your private keys or passwords if you lose or forget them and cannot guarantee transaction confirmation as they do not have control over the Bitcoin network.
